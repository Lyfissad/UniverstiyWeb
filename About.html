        <p id="stuText">Forman Christian College (A Chartered University) welcomes students from across Pakistan and
            beyond. From a
            Forman perspective, a diverse student population that “looks like Pakistan” is one of its strongest assets.
            This diversity extends to include students from all socio-economic groups, ethnic backgrounds, religious
            communities and geographic regions of the country.

            UNIVERSITY (BACCALAUREATE AND POST-GRADUATE)
            According to figures collected in Spring 2021, university enrollment at Forman totaled 5,114 students, of
            whom 2,308 (45 percent) were female and 2,806 (55 percent) were male. Female representation was highest at
            the post-graduate level at 68 percent, with 350 out of a total of 517 being women.

            While Forman students at the university level predominantly come from Punjab (96 percent), Forman also
            attracts representation from Sind, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Northern Areas. Also, 12 percent
            (605 students) of Forman’s student population are from the country’s minority Christian community.</p>

    <div id="history">
        <h1 id="hisheading">OUR HISTORY</h1>
        <p id="hisText">Forman Christian College was Founded in 1864 by Dr Charles W Forman, a Presbyterian missionary
            from the USA. The college was initially known as the Lahore Mission College, but in 1894 the name was
            officially changed to Forman Christian College in honor of the founder. In the early years, degrees were
            awarded through the Calcutta University. College level instruction was interrupted in 1869 due to the
            illness of key faculty members. College classes resumed in 1886, with degrees being awarded through the
            University of the Punjab. In 2004, FCCU became a chartered University and from 2009 onwards has awarded its
            own degrees.</p>

        <p id="hisText2">The early years of the college were marked by rapid growth in enrollment, and a constant struggle to find
            enough space to house the growing college. Enrollment grew from 18 students in 1886 to 130 in 1890, 311 in
            1900, 426 in 1910 and 600 in 1915. Enrollment had reached 1,500 students by the time the college was
            nationalized in 1972. Enrollment in the University section alone stands at 3,200 students today.</p>

        <p id="hisText2">The campus was located in the Anarkali (Nila Gumbad) area of Lahore for many years. Four major buildings
            were constructed by the college on that campus by 1916, and Ewing Hall, built in 1916, is still used as a
            hostel by the college. In 1940 the college moved to its present spacious campus of over 100 acres on the
            scenic banks of Lahore Canal.</p>

            <p id="hisText2">FCCU has been served by a large number of distinguished educational leaders and teachers throughout its
            history. Dr CW Forman, Dr Sir JCR Ewing, Dr CH Rice, Dr ED Lucas, Dr SK Dutta, Dr HC Velte, Dr JH Orbison,
            Noble Laureate Dr Arthur Compton, Maulvi Muhammad Bakar, Dr HD Griswold, Prof JM Benade, Shamsul Ulema

            Ali, Dr RH Ewing, Dr EJ Sinclair, Dr Robert F Tebbe and Dr Carl Wheeless are among many who have impacted
            the lives of students and shaped the future of the college through the years. Under their leadership, the
            college became widely regarded as one of the very best in the entire subcontinent.For many decades, FCCU has
            been widely recognized for its meritorious work of nurturing and consolidating the social and intellectual
            capital of Pakistan. The college motto, “By love serve one another,” has been a guiding principle for
            Formanites throughout the history of the college. Among the graduates of the college are two Presidents of
            Pakistan, a Prime Minister of India, the first Chief Justice of Pakistan, a number of Governors and Chief
            Ministers of the Punjab and other provinces, an Attorney General of Pakistan, two Foreign Ministers of
            Pakistan, a President of the Security Council of the United Nations, numerous Ambassadors to other nations,
            a Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, a Chairman of the Senate, several Speakers of the National
            Assembly, numerous Generals and Admirals and an equally impressive list of leaders in the fields of
            education, law, medicine, arts and entertainment.FCCU is ranked as a ‘W’ Category University by the HEC. It
