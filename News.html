            <h1 id="news">FCCU Humanities collaborates with Lahore Arts Council</h1>
            <p id="newsDets">A meeting was held by Lahore Arts Council with Dr Altaf Ullah Khan, Dean of Humanities
                Forman Christian College; Chief Information Commissioner, Punjab; and Representatives of GIZ to initiate
                a first-of-its-kind project in Punjab in raising awareness about Right to Information and Right to
                Services (RTI & RTS), which are more about transparency in a society and governance. The aim of the
                project is to strengthen the democratic processes by grassroot empowerment and through awareness. An
                agreement has been signed between GIZ-Support to Local Governance Programme (LoGo II) and Lahore Arts
                Council to support Punjab Information Commissions in their outreach and awareness campaigns on right to
                information. Lahore Arts Council and FCCU will work in a consortium on the project.</p>

            <p id="newsDets">In this awareness campaign the Humanities Discipline at FCCU will select and train young
                students as
                Women Champions and Ambassadors to serve as influencers and multipliers during the project by engaging
                in project interventions. Four districts of Punjab, namely Lahore, Khanewal, Sheikhupura and Toba Tek
                Singh have been selected for the implementation of focused and targeted awareness campaigns. Social
                media and mainstream media campaigns by the government in the awareness program will also be monitored
                about the progress in raising awareness by interaction, group discussions and community participation.

            <h1 id="news">FCCU Shines in Global Rankings 2020: QS Ranking.</h1>
            <p id="newsDets">Recently FCCU was named in Times Higher Education’s World’s Best Small Universities 2020
                list. In addition, the 2022 QS World University Rankings has FCCU ranked amongst the top 651-700
                universities in the world. QS or Quacquarelli Symonds University Rankings are one of the most
                prestigious and recognised international university rankings in the world. The assessment criteria for
                universities follows six key metrics; academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty to student
                ratio, citations per faculty, ratio of international faculty members and ratio of international
                students. Once again, FCCU’ strongest performance indicator was employer reputation. This is an
                extension of the University’s presence in the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2020 as the ‘top-ranked
                university in Pakistan’.</p>

            <p id="newsDets">FCCU’ prominence in these global rankings speaks of the University’s quality of teaching
                and research.
                Sharing his thoughts on the recognition, Dr. Arshad Ahmad, Vice Chancellor FCCU, said, “The University
                has ranked between number 151-200 in the QS World University Rankings by Subject and at 121 in the Asia
                University Rankings. These rankings reaffirm that in a relatively short time span, FCCU has built a
                reputation as a leading educational institution in Pakistan and beyond. I congratulate our faculty and
                staff as well as our students, whose individual efforts have helped to collectively enhance FCCU'
                reputation.”</p></div>

            <h1 id="news">Alumni Achieve Top Positions in the CSS Exams 2020</h1>
            <p id="newsDets">This year 20 FCCU graduates have passed the Central Superior Services (CSS) examinations of
                Pakistan. FCCU alumna, Maheen Hassan, a graduate of BSc 2011, has topped the CSS and has been inducted
                into the Pakistan Administrative Services (PAS). This outstanding achievement is a source of great pride
                for the FCCU community. She is currently working as Assistant Commissioner at the Federal Board of
                Revenue. Her main goal, however, was to work at PAS, which she has achieved.</p>

            <p id="newsDets">Another FCCU graduate making it to the PAS group is Muhammad Ali Zafar from the class of 2017. An alum
                of the Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani School of Humanities and Social Sciences has achieved 4th position overall
                in Pakistan.</p>

            <p id="newsDets">For the past few years, an increasing number of FCCU students and alumni are appearing for and qualified
                for this competitive examination after graduation. Thousands of candidates appear each year, but only a
                few are selected. In 2020, over 18,553 candidates appeared for the CSS exam from all over Pakistan, out
                of which only 376 were able to qualify. </p>
